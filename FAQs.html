            is divided into three types:
            <br>

            i. Primary Health Care: The first contact for health care for most people is usually the
            primary health care generalist providing primary care. The people at this level are
            generalists. They are not specialists.

            Increasing number of patients with lifestyle diseases call for more primary health care
            facilities.<br>

            ii. Secondary Health Care: The health care provided by a specialist is known as
            secondary health care. This is the second tier in the system.<br>

            iii. Tertiary Health Care: Tertiary health care includes treatment that is advanced and
            complex. Tertiary health care includes services provided for major surgeries such as
            plastic surgery, cardiac surgery, and other complex surgeries. It also includes services
            provided for cancer management, treating severe burns, etc.</p><br>

                providers are majorly divided into following categories:<br>
<br>
                i. Preventive care services: The steps taken to prevent a particular disease are known
                as preventive care. Here you are treating neither the disease nor the symptoms. These
                services include various immunization programs that help to prevent diseases.<br>
